## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the application locally.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/react-invoice-app.git
    cd react-invoice-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Use npm or yarn to install the necessary dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or if you're using **yarn**:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Redux Toolkit Setup**

The app uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management. The `invoiceSlice.js` manages the state for invoices, including fetching the list of invoices, tracking loading and error states.

- **Action Types**: `fetchInvoicesStart`, `fetchInvoicesSuccess`, `fetchInvoicesFailure`
- **Initial State**: Includes `data`, `loading`, and `error`.

### **2. React Router Setup**

The app uses **React Router** to handle routing. The main route is `/invoices` for displaying the list of invoices.

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
3. Fetching Data
The app connects to an API to retrieve invoice data. Data is fetched asynchronously and stored in the Redux state. The invoices are displayed in the InvoiceList component, which handles pagination and loading states.

4. UI Components
InvoiceList: Displays a list of invoices with pagination.
Modal: Displays detailed information about an individual invoice when clicked.
Running the Application
Development Mode
Once the setup is complete, you can run the application in development mode.

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000.

Production Build
To create a production build of the app, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Afterward, you can serve the production build using a static server:

bash
Copy code
npm run serve
API Integration
The app integrates with an API that provides invoice data. It assumes that the API supports the following endpoints:

Invoice Endpoints
GET /invoices: Fetch a paginated list of invoices.

Query parameters:

page: The current page for pagination (default: 1).
limit: The number of invoices per page (default: 10).
Example request:

bash
Copy code
GET http://localhost:3000/invoices?page=1&limit=10
GET /invoices/:id: Fetch the details of a specific invoice by its ID.

GET /invoices/total: Get the total amount of invoices, grouped by due date.

Error Handling
Error handling is implemented in the Redux state. The InvoiceList component displays appropriate error messages if there is an issue with fetching data. The loading state is managed and displayed until the data is successfully retrieved.
